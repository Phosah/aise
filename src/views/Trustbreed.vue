            <p>For this project, my role was to explore ways to ensure users' complaints are heard and resolutions to the problems were made, also give users a way to identify the best companies and services for a particular need. To achieve this I had to understand the pain points of users of digital and physical services through a series of research, analysis, and best practices in UX design. Then sealing it with good visuals to make the interface attractive for the users.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project timeline, there was a triangular interaction between myself, users, and the stakeholders.</p>

                    <p class="mb-8">As a user / a customer, you have just one reason for patronizing a product or a service, and the result is the solution to their problems which results in user satisfaction.</p>
                    <p class="mb-8">Over a couple of years, there has been a massive growth of user complaints from a lot of products in which most of the complaints were caught with deaf ears by the service providers and users having to adapt or manage substandard services provided especially in a monopolized system, while some other users felt their illiteracy was the reason for their struggles and accepted their fate and endured the bad services.</p>
                    <p>The second problem is the ability of users to find the best products to pick to solve their needs in a pool of similar products</p>

            <p class="mb-8">Initially, I was running a survey that turned out to be a tremendous information-gathering tool. It helped me to gauge in-depth insights into the target users, including their pains, their frequency, and how they deal with them. Based on the results, I could formulate specific interview questions to find out more about how they deal with poor services and how what they get to do afterward</p>
            <p class="mb-8">Organizing the interviews was the most challenging part of the user research process - but conducting them was highly exciting. Listening to users talk about their experiences with poor services helped me to further refine the problem statement. Below holds some of the questions and the collated results</p>
