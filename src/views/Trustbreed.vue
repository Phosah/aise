            <p>For this project, my role was to explore ways to ensure users' complaints are heard and resolutions to the problems were made, also give users a way to identify the best companies and services for a particular need. To achieve this I had to understand the pain points of users of digital and physical services through a series of research, analysis, and best practices in UX design. Then sealing it with good visuals to make the interface attractive for the users.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project timeline, there was a triangular interaction between myself, users, and the stakeholders.</p>

                    <p class="mb-8">As a user / a customer, you have just one reason for patronizing a product or a service, and the result is the solution to their problems which results in user satisfaction.</p>
                    <p class="mb-8">Over a couple of years, there has been a massive growth of user complaints from a lot of products in which most of the complaints were caught with deaf ears by the service providers and users having to adapt or manage substandard services provided especially in a monopolized system, while some other users felt their illiteracy was the reason for their struggles and accepted their fate and endured the bad services.</p>
                    <p>The second problem is the ability of users to find the best products to pick to solve their needs in a pool of similar products</p>

            <p class="mb-8">Organizing the interviews was the most challenging part of the user research process - but conducting them was highly exciting.

                <p class="mb-16">Reviewing my personas and user journeys and having certain features in mind, I started to think about the structure of the app. I had a rough idea of keeping the structure simple with co-existing hierarchies, since there is a great deal of overlapping information and wanted my users to have easy access from one page to the other.</p>

                <p class="mb-16">After that, I started creating wireframes with pen and paper. Having the hand-drawn screens, I made a low-ﬁdelity prototype putting them together to represent the user ﬂow.</p>

                    <p class="">The complaint creation is the centerpiece of the product whereby every user can come into trustbreed and make a complaint about a company that has rendered them poor service. If the company doesn’t exist on trustbreed, you can create them and the company is verified before finally listed. Every complaint submitted would be followed up by trustbreeds agents till the issue is resolved through constant communication with the company and the users</p>

                <p>A lot of users are on the lookout for the best product for their needs, due to the long list of competitors for popular services the best is a bit tricky to pick, hence trustbreed gives you the ability to compare companies based on data, and other users ratings and reviews.</p>

                <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                <p class="mb-8">I wanted to observe and measure if users understand the product, its value, and how to complete basic functions through testing the high-ﬁdelity prototype. Below were the test objectives;</p>
                <ul class="list-disc mb-8 pl-10">
                    <li>Observe if users can make a complaints easily</li>
                    <li>Observe if users were able to easily find a particular company they were looking for</li>
                    <li>Observe if users on making a complaint and didn't find the company if they were able to suggest the company to trustbreed</li>
                    <li>Observe how easy it was to find companies to compare.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Both in-person and remote moderated usability tests were conducted.  The test included a short brieﬁng and task performance with the Trustbreed. 5 participants took part in the usability test, all participants agreed that the app is uncomplicated and simple to use, including mainly only necessary information and buttons. After collecting the information, I created a rainbow sheet to identify valuable insights.</p>

            <p class="mb-16">Throughout the design process, I learned how to prioritize and be very careful in user experience in the product, a product that is built upon the basis of bad user experiences of other products, the user experience could not be compromised. I got the opportunity to. Thank you for following and going through my documented processes. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn, Behance, Dribbble, and Twitter.</p>
