            <p>For this project, my role was to explore ways to ensure users' complaints are heard and resolutions to the problems were made, also give users a way to identify the best companies and services for a particular need. To achieve this I had to understand the pain points of users of digital and physical services through a series of research, analysis, and best practices in UX design. Then sealing it with good visuals to make the interface attractive for the users.</p>
            <p>Throughout the project timeline, there was a triangular interaction between myself, users, and the stakeholders.</p>

                    <p class="mb-8">As a user / a customer, you have just one reason for patronizing a product or a service, and the result is the solution to their problems which results in user satisfaction.</p>
                    <p class="mb-8">Over a couple of years, there has been a massive growth of user complaints from a lot of products in which most of the complaints were caught with deaf ears by the service providers and users having to adapt or manage substandard services provided especially in a monopolized system, while some other users felt their illiteracy was the reason for their struggles and accepted their fate and endured the bad services.</p>
                    <p>The second problem is the ability of users to find the best products to pick to solve their needs in a pool of similar products</p>

            <p class="mb-8">I was given two potential competitors by the founders and stakeholders began my study on them and built their marketing profile, SWOT profile, and conducted a UX analysis of their products. The goal was to identify what type of problems users face with competitorsâ€™ products, as well as understand what the users might expect from my product.</p>
