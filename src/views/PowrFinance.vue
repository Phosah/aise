                <p class="mb-8">Every good product is built upon solving a problem, and the root of every problem lies with understanding the pain points of users and when none is visible, understanding the limitations users are both aware and unaware of to bring a solution to make life better for them.</p>
                <p class="mb-16">Over a couple of years, there has been a massive growth of service providers extending their services globally and vice versa, whereby making transactions was the main issue. Sending money abroad prevented vendors from purchasing the necessary pieces of equipment needed for their businesses and receiving payments made it hard to carry out good business. Likewise, for the freelancers, a lot could not offer their services to foreign clients because receiving payments was getting difficult, and using banks, the processes to getting a DOM account was a lot of stress and the bank charges were outrageous</p>
